# Multi-Class-Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Support-Vector-Machine(SVM) project involves using machine learning to categorize iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their measurements. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the SVM algorithm, which is particularly effective for multi-class classification problems. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning and SVM in a real-world classification problem

The key points are:
1.SVM is used for multi-class classification by breaking down the problem into multiple binary classification problems using the One-vs-One or One-vs-Rest approach
2.The RBF kernel is commonly used for non-linear classification problems like Iris
3.Scaling the features is important for SVM to work well
The accuracy score will depend on the specific train-test split, but typically SVM achieves high accuracy on the Iris dataset, often over 95%
