# Multi-Class-Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Support-Vector-Machine(SVM) project involves using machine learning to categorize iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their measurements. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using the SVM algorithm, which is particularly effective for multi-class classification problems. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning and SVM in a real-world classification problem
